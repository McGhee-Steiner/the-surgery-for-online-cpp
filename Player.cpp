/**
 * Name: split1()
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. If an empty string is provided then return 0.
 * 2. Create variable for number of pieces the input text string was split into
 * 3. Create variable to store character position (in input string) of last instance of delimiter
 * 4. Run for loop to check each character of input string for an instance of delimiter (condition is (length - 1) because the last character will not be a delimiter)
 * 5. Analyze every character of string (starting with char 0) for delimiter and take appropriate steps
 * 6. If delimiter is found, add value of one to number of pieces the input text string was split into and create variable to store substring between delimiters (treating the area before the beginning of the input string as a delimiter)
 * 7. Store string up until there and since the last instance of delimiter as a value in our array.
 * 8. Store array value string in array.
 * 9. Update variable that holds position of last delimiter for more recent found delimiter.
 * 10. Add one to num_splits to represent final value in array (that's not followed by a delimiter)
 * 11. Once all delimiters are found, declare the last substring after the last found delimiter as the last value in the array
 * 12. If the string is split into more pieces than the size of the array (the last parameter), then the function returns -1. The array should be filled with as many pieces of the split string as is possible.
 * 13. If the delimiter character is not found, then the function returns 1 and the entire string is placed in the array as the first element.
 * 14. Return size of array.

 * Parameters:
 * input_string string: The text string containing data separated by a delimiter
 * separator char: The delimiter marking the location where the string should be split up
 * arr string array: The array that will be used to store the input text string's individual string pieces
 * arr_size int: The number of elements that can be stored in the array
 * Return Value: int: The number of pieces the input text string was split into
