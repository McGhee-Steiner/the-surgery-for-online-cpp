ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
Playfully named "The Surgery", this project simulates some pillars of the process of accessing 
gender-affirming surgery. The game takes the user through four of the most challenging steps, which 
must be completed chronologically: coming out, getting insurance, selecting a surgeon and getting 
therapist approval, all while managing three main restrictions: time, money and energy. If the player 
can make it to the final day (the Day of Reckoning) with sufficient funds, non-zero energy levels, and 
all steps complete, they win the prize of getting The Surgery.
